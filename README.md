# guiVcpkg
Graphical interface for vcpkg (package manager for C/C++)

Find the package you need in the All tab, select it and click Install. After installation, the package will be displayed in the list of installed packages in the Installed tab.

Similarly, you can remove a package from the Installed tab using the Remove button.

You can monitor the installation/removal process of the package using the Status field, where up-to-date information is displayed.

You can choose a custom path to vcpkg.exe using the button under the table with packages. You can see the current path to the left of this button. After restarting the program, you do not need to specify the path again, it is saved after each path change.
